# Number Spiral

## Description

The function `printIntegerSpiral` takes a square number minus 1, and then it logs and returns a 2D spiral matrix of the number.

- The returned spriral starts in the middle cell of the 2D array at 0.
- The spiral subsequently loops right, down, left and up, in that order. 
- For even squares, it starts in the central 2x2 matrix in the top left cell. (i.e. row 1, column 1 for input 15)
- For odd squares, it starts in the exact middle cell. (i.e. row 4, column 4 for input 48)

## Error Handling

- This function checks that the input is an integer and a square number.
